# CAUSE: An Adaptive Exact Unlearning System on Resource-Constrained Devices

## CAUSE Code:
### The example data and the associated codes in our experiments are released here.

### Language Version:
Python 3.9.18

### Packages:
Libraries including Tensorflow, Keras, Tensorflow_model_optimization, and Zipfile are leveraged for model training, pruning, and compression, while Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Timeit are utilized for matrix procession, figure presentation, and time recording. NVML from NVIDIA is also leveraged for energy calculation on normal servers. Regarding energy consumption on NVIDIA JETSON ORIN NANO, the module installed on NANO is used.

####  Quick Set-up: 
Following are the packages required in CAUSE system. This is a quick set-up to help you get your environment prepared.
```
pip install tensorflow/keras # tensorflow 2.15.0
pip install tensorflow-model-optimization # tensorflow-model-optimization 0.8.0 
pip install numpy # numpy 1.25.1
pip install pandas # pandas 1.5.3
pip install scipy # scipy 1.11.1
pip install math 
pip install timeit
```

#### Notes:
More detailed codes will be updated soon...
